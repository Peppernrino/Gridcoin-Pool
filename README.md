# Gridcoin-Pool

The idea is to have the fastest guaranteed payouts of any pool. I want to be able to give out coins within a day or two, TOPS.

Staking as a newb is hard... we can make it easier.

By taking the delta of yesterday's credit vs today's, we can -sort of- figure out how much magnitude is to be expected, and at least pay out a lesser amount.
